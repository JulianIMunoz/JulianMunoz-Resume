        <div class="subheading mb-5">Computer Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently studying at UC Riverside in order to become a computer scientist. I have always had a passion for technology and its advancements that only go to improve day to day life. Throughout my life I have taken steps to improve my knowledge of computer languages in order to thoroughly cement myself as a highly informed and capable member of any programming team. Certain activities such as joining clubs, choosing classes, and my own personal research have been largely decided by my desire to enter the field of computer science. Furthermore, my work ethic is both reliable and effective, allowing me to complete a given task promptly and impeccably. I am also entirely willing to take on a variety of coding jobs, even if they vary greatly from one another, as I find working on differing tasks both engaging and as a learning experience that will only go to serve me later on in life.<br><br>

        Even while I was still in high school, examples of my strong work ethic and determination shone through. I took on a number of extracurricular activities, whilst still managing to almost never fall behind on any work that had been assigned. While in junior year, I joined a programming club that I remained a part of up until the end of high school. Within the club, I learned the fundamentals of a few computer languages such as Scratch, Python, and HTML. In addition to extracurricular activities, I also found myself gaining a part time job with a nursery. I commonly had to work with other members of the team, provide a welcoming atmosphere to all customers, and carry around heavy equipment, all of which I did with stride. I love working with other people and contributing to a group effort. I am also just as comfortable working alone on a solo project. Whether I am put into a high or low energy environment, I will be able to handle either scenario with little to no strain.<br><br>

        After high school, I continued my education into computer science. Making it my major as well as registering for programming and computing courses. My goal is to attain a Bachelor's degree in computer science by 2025. It is also highly likely that I will continue my education path further, possibly obtaining a Master’s degree. So far, all classes that I have attended relating to the field of computer science have been highly enjoyable and only give me a further desire to pursue a career within this field of study. I am especially interested in the more complex aspects of programming such as artificial intelligence and video game programming. After completing the first four years of my college career, I am adamant that I will be an excellent choice for any computing related job, as I will be even more capable than I am now.
